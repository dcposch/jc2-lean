/-! # Later-deep lower `(6,8)` window `3n ≤ 2g ≤ 5n`

Tracked I4 already records the mixed walls `2g = 3n` and `2g = 5n` and
the ordinary `F₄` face between them.  This module extracts the matching
I3 face, proves that row-one is load-free after the extra `alpha`/`c`/`gamma`
cancellations, and closes the open interval `3n < 2g < 5n` to the ordinary
five-face `e = 0`, `a*b = 3d`.  The two walls keep mixed I4 together with
mixed `F₂`/`F₀`; they are not empty.
