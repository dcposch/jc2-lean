/-- Exact nonsquare-chamber eleventh packet of a normalized aligned
scale-two `(4,10)` source: the identifying chamber data, the parity
kill `M₁₈ ≡ 0` (with `κ₁₀ = 0` forced), and the `q`-free block
identity on the fifth face's divisibility `g² - 4 p₂ = H f` — the
first aligned nonsquare row consuming NO letter. -/
