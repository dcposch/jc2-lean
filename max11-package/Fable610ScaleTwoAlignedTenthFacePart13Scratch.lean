/-- Exact nonsquare-chamber tenth packet of a normalized aligned
scale-two `(6,10)` source: the chamber-free integral `Ω = κ₉ H²⁵`
survives, the carried divisors peel the head cascade (the `p₂` divisor
squared, then the `t₃` divisor cubed), the NEW divisibility
`243 p₁ - g₁ u = H v` transfers the perfect-square head — the FIRST
`p₁` constraint of the aligned tower — and `q₀` is solved OUTRIGHT
with `κ₉` at level ZERO on top of the carried solved `q₁, q₂`. -/
