/-! # Single-monomial chamber kills, `(8,10)` scale zero

11 face-degree lemmas and 550 chamber kills: every leaf whose
level-0 certificate is a single monomial *and* whose eight load columns
are either empty, dominated by the chamber's own ℕ conjuncts, or covered
by the κ band of `…ChamberBandsScratch`.  Which leaves those are is
decided, with exact rational Farkas certificates, by
`scripts/derive_810_quartic_chamber_killplan.py`; the rest are named in
the residual.  Untracked working note.
