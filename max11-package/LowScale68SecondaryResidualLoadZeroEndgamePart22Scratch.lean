/-! # Residual endgame on the `(6,8)` strip `2g<n` after `l=0`

The tracked residual selector/endgame closes `3g<n`.  After `l=0` every
`A^4`/`A^5` Jacobian load vanishes, so the residual walls `8n<9n-3g` and
`10n<11n-3g` hold throughout `g<n`.  This module replays the precise
invariant/load and row-two/row-one degree cutoffs needed by the tracked
middle/selector/descent/row-two/balanced/row-one/endgame chain under the
weaker chamber `l=0` and `2g<n`, then excludes that whole strip.
