/-! # Extracting the first `(6,8)` secondary face

This module connects the abstract scalar face classified in
`LowScale68SecondaryFace` to the literal polynomial lower system.  The four
transverse coordinates have different secondary degree bounds, so the usual
single weighted-boundary lemmas are first replaced by arbitrary-bound
coefficient rules.
