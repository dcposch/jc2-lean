/-! # Scale-zero tenth cleared defect for the normalized `(6,10)`, `H = 0` leaf

Continuation of `Grok610ScaleZeroNinthDefectScratch` on the constant core
`H = (C t)²`.  The ninth packet already forces the discriminator `N` and
the weight-fifty defect `ι` to ground constants, including the exact
selector `18 q₀ h⁵⁰`.  This file consumes the next unused Keller
coefficient, the degree-`4` Jacobian row

```
(p₄)' (1 q₁) + (p₃)' (2 q₂) + (p₂)' (3 q₃) + (p₁)' (4 q₄) + (p₀)' (5 q₅)
  - (5 p₅) q₀' - (4 p₄) q₁' - (3 p₃) q₂' - (2 p₂) q₃' - (1 p₁) q₄' = 0
```

of the same monic depression.  After the sextic change that kills `z⁵`,
that row is
`5 S E' + 4 T D' + 3 U C' + 2 V B' + W A' - D T' - 2 C U' - 3 B V'
- 4 A W' = 0`.  The corresponding first integral `κ` clears to the
weight-fifty-five polynomial defect, and at scale zero that defect is
again a ground-field constant.

This file supersedes the unverified `Grok610ScaleZeroTenthDefectScratch`
attempt.  Its `κ` formula, weight-fifty-five clearing, and packet wiring
were re-derived independently and port unchanged; the derivation-in-zero
reduction is completed with the full constant-derivative kill set
(`d (385/31104) = 0` through `d (A⁵)`), whose absence left opaque
derivative atoms in the final `linear_combination`, and the aligned
`λ = 0` specialization states the literal `132`-monomial residue instead
of a reflexive identity.

The degree-`5` iota first integral and the exact `18 q₀ h⁵⁰` residual
are preserved and not cleared to zero.  No total-degree or twice-prime
theorem is used.  A constant scale has no finite root, so the scale-two
eleventh-face jet is unavailable.  Both the vanishing and the nonzero
constant branches of `λ` and of the weight-fifty and weight-fifty-five
defects are kept.  The packet does not close the leaf: unused Jacobian
coefficients start at degree `3`.
